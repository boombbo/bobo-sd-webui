# Background

This is the spec for proposal
[Windows App Runtime Deployment API #1240](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/issues/1240).

The Windows App SDK (WinAppSDK) for packaged apps involves the framework, main, and singleton
packages, which are all signed and published by Microsoft. The framework package contains the
WinAppSDK binaries used at run time, and it is installed with the application. The main package
contains out-of-process services that are brokered between apps, such as push notifications, and it
is also needed for the framework to be serviced by the Microsoft Store. The singleton package
supports a single long-running process that is brokered between apps for features like push
notifications.

Currently, packaged apps can only declare dependencies on framework packages. In order to get the
other packages (main, singleton) deployed, apps can use the mechanism described here as part of
their first-run experience.

> **Note that in Windows App SDK version 1.0**, only MSIX packaged apps that are full trust or have
> the packageManagement restricted capability have the permission to use the Deployment API to
> install the main and singleton package dependencies. Support for partial trust packaged apps will
> be coming in later releases. Additionally, support for main and singleton package deployment
> through the Microsoft Store will be coming in later releases.

# Description

When a packaged app using the WinAppSDK is deployed from the Store, it will be installed with the
application's main package and the WinAppSDK framework package. The WinAppSDK main and singleton
packages may not already be present on the system, or may not be at the version required by the
application. The Deployment API enables a developer to check when the required WinAppSDK main and
singleton packages are missing and get them installed.

Since the Deployment API is part of the WinAppSDK framework package, the framework itself must be
present. To deploy the framework package with the MSIX packaged application, the framework must be
declared as a dependency in the application manifest with a min version specified. For instructions
on deploying the framework package, see the
[developer docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/deploy-packaged-apps#deploy-the-windows-app-sdk-framework-package).

If a developer prefers to have the Microsoft Store automatically service the WinAppSDK framework
package and if features like push notifications are desired, then the main and singleton should also
be deployed. Developers must not assume that the WinAppSDK main and singleton packages are already
present on the system, or that the version present is the minimum version required by the
application. Instead, the Deployment API should be used to validate that the WinAppSDK is at the
correct version and that all required packages are present.

The Deployment API addresses the following two developer scenarios:

1. Does this system have the min version of the WinAppSDK main and singleton packages required by my
   app?
2. How do I install these packages, if they are not already present on the system?

The API addresses #1 by a simple query of the version needed and a check for OS updates.

#2 has two possible answers.

-   First, the developer can install the packages directly through the app, if possible. These MSIX
    packages can be acquired through
    [Downloads page](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/downloads).
-   Alternatively, MSIX packaged apps that are full trust or have the packageManagement restricted
    capability can use the Deployment API to get these packages installed.

# Examples

## GetStatus

This is the means by which an app or program can call to verify that all required packages are
present to a minimum version needed by the framework loaded with the app. A process should call
GetStatus() after process initialization and before using Windows App Runtime content (e.g. in
main() or WinMain()).

Developers call this method without parameters, as all information about the version, channel, and
architecture are derived from the current WinAppSDK framework package loaded.

```C#
    DeploymentResult result = DeploymentManager.GetStatus();
    if (result.Status == DeploymentStatus.Ok)
    {
        // WindowsAppRuntime is in a good state and ready for use.
    }
    else
    {
        // WindowsAppRuntime is not in a good state.
        // Should call Initialize on another thread, or not use features that require the
        // WindowsAppRuntime. result.ExtendedError has the error code that has the reason
        // for the Status.
    }
```

## Initialize

This API performs a status check, and if the main and/or singleton packages are missing or not at
the required version, it will attempt to deploy those packages and get the WindowsAppRuntime into an
OK state. All information about the version, channel, and architecture needed are derived from the
current WinAppSDK framework package.

Since both the main _and_ the singleton packages may need to be installed, it is possible that one
package is installed successfully but not the other. If so, the returned WindowsAppRuntimeStatus
will contain the error, if one occurs during package install. There will be no rollback of any
successfully installed packages. See the
[developer docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/deploy-packaged-apps#address-installation-errors)
for instructions on how to handle errors.

The install of the packages may take a couple seconds to complete, which may be a performance
concern to some developers. To address these concerns, developers can instead call GetStatus() first
and verify that the required packages are missing. If so, then call Initialize() on another thread
to handle the time delay more elegantly.

Once the main and singleton packages have been deployed, they generally do not need to be deployed
again. If a user were to remove the main or singleton package, the API can be used to reinstall them
again.

```C#
    if (DeploymentManager.GetStatus().Status != DeploymentStatus.Ok)
    {
        // Initialize does a status check, and if the status is not Ok it will attempt to get
        // the WindowsAppRuntime into a good state by deploying packages. Unlike a simple
        // status check, Initialize can sometimes take several seconds to deploy the packages.
        // These should be run on a separate thread so as not to hang your app while the
        // packages deploy.
        var initializeTask = Task.Run(() => DeploymentManager.Initialize());
        initializeTask.Wait();

        // Check the result.
        if (initializeTask.Result.Status != DeploymentStatus.Ok)
        {
            // The WindowsAppRuntime is in a bad state which Initialize() did not fix.
            // Do error reporting or gather information for submitting a bug.
            // Gracefully exit the program or carry on without using the WindowsAppRuntime.
        }
    }
```

# API Details

```c#
namespace Microsoft.Windows.ApplicationModel.WindowsAppRuntime
{
    /// Represents the current Deployment status of the WindowsAppRuntime
    enum DeploymentStatus
    {
        Unknown = 0,
        Ok,
        PackageInstallRequired,
        PackageInstallFailed,
    };

    /// Represents the a result of a Deployment Manager method.
    runtimeclass DeploymentResult
    {
        DeploymentResult(DeploymentStatus status, HRESULT extendedError);

        /// Returns the DeploymentStatus of the result.
        DeploymentStatus Status { get; };

        /// Returns the first encountered error if there was an error or S_OK if no error.
        HRESULT ExtendedError{ get; };
    };

    /// Used to query deployment information for WindowsAppRuntime
    static runtimeclass DeploymentManager
    {
        /// Returns the current deployment status of the current package's Windows App Runtime.
        static DeploymentResult GetStatus();

        /// Checks the status of the WindowsAppRuntime of the current package and attempts to
        /// register any missing packages that can be registered.
        static DeploymentResult Initialize();
    };
}
```
