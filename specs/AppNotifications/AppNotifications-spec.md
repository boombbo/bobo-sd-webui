# App Notifications in Windows App SDK

# Background

App Notifications are UI popups that contain rich text, controls and images to display a message to
the user. It is not sufficient for a Notification popup on the screen to simply be displayed to the
user, it should be actionable. The user should be able to click on a Notification popup to launch an
app in the correct context. For example, a news article related Notification is expected to launch
the News app along with the article in question in the foreground. Another actionable scenario is
for the user to actually interact with the contents of the Notification popup like a UI control
button. For example, a messaging app like Teams that displays a message from another user could have
a "Respond To" textbox and button so that the user can directly respond to the message in the popup
without having to launch the application. This scenario triggers a background process on behalf of
the application (with no UI) which inturn processes the "Reply To" message and forwards the response
to the other device.

Notifications could have a local or cloud based origin. In the case of Local Notifications, the
message always originates from the app installed on the device. For Cloud Notifications, the message
always originates from a remote application service that targets the locally installed app in
question.

## The problems today

**Cloud Notification integration with Windows App SDK**: While we support Push scenarios for Raw
Notifications in WinAppSDK, we do not support Cloud Sourced App Notifications. We need to fill this
gap.

**API fragmentation**: There are too many API technologies that display Notifications and setup
their activation handlers today: Windows SDK, Desktop App Activations via the COM Model and the
Windows Toolkit which is a Nuget library. It gets overwhelming for a developer who does not
understand all these technologies to ramp up and get Notifications working for their app.

**Support and Troubleshooting Notifcation Issues**: Because of the API fragmentation mentioned
above, it is also very difficult to diagnose issues when developers hit them and a large portion of
developer cycles are spent diagnosing and troubleshooting problems in various API stacks instead of
a single stack.

**Registration**: The Windows SDK today provides AppId overloads to developers who can specify their
own Identifier for Unpackaged apps. This overloaded AppId causes all sorts of problems including
string size limits being hit, Personally Identifiable Information stored as part of AppIds, invalid
Desktop Registrations etc. The WinApp SDK gets rid of the AppId overloads in the Public APIs and
ensures that we don't hit any of the above issues.

**Activation**: Setting up activation handlers using Background Triggers is challenging for
developers because we don't have downlevel support for versions prior to 1903. Moreover, the steps
for setting up activation handlers vary greatly for different app types: MSIX Vs Unpackaged Vs UWP.
We will abstract away the activation technology and simplify this process for OS SKUs from RS5
onwards.

# Description

The WinAppSDK AppNotification APIs enable all Desktop applications to display the same rich UI
pop-ups that they are used to doing today minus all the complexities and overhead described above.
Desktop applications include Unpackaged apps and Packaged win32 (MSIX Desktop Bridge, Sparse Signed
Packages). The SDK implementation will ensure that all Notification scenarios will adhere to OS
resource management policies like Power Saver, Network Attribution (reporting the amount of data an
app uses), Group Policies, etc. The SDK will also abstract away the complexities of dealing with
Notification delivery and related activations as much as possible freeing the developer to focus on
other app related challenges.

The App Notification API allows Packaged and Unpackaged apps to:

-   Use common APIs to Register and Unregister Notifications.
-   Use common APIs to display Cloud Sourced Notifications.
-   Use common APIs to display Local Notifications.
-   Use common APIs to Update/Delete Notifications.
-   Use AppLifecycle constructs and event handlers to process invoke operations on behalf of the
    user.

# Examples

## Registering and handling a notification

Packaged and Unpackaged Desktop apps will need to register themselves to handle App Notifications.
For Packaged apps, WinAppSDK will use the CLSID defined in the appx manifest to register the current
process as the COM Server for Notification invokes. The process.exe declared in the manifest will
have to be the same process calling into Register() for the API call to succeed. For Unpackaged
apps, WinAppSDK will determine appropriate DisplayName and and Icon. The current process module(.exe
file) will be the COM Server for Notification invokes.

```cpp

int main()
{
    // To ensure all Notification handling happens in this process instance, register for
    // NotificationInvoked before calling Register(). Without this a new process will
    // be launched to handle the notification.
    const auto token = winrt::AppNotificationManager::Default().NotificationInvoked([](const auto&, const winrt::AppNotificationActivatedEventArgs& notificationActivatedEventArgs)
    {
        ProcessNotificationArgs(notificationActivatedEventArgs);
    });

    auto manager = winrt::AppNotificationManager::Default();
    manager.Register();

    auto args = winrt::AppInstance::GetCurrent().GetActivatedEventArgs();
    auto kind = args.Kind();

    if (kind == winrt::ExtendedActivationKind::Launch)
    {
        // App does Launch Stuff Here
    }
    else if (kind == winrt::ExtendedActivationKind::AppNotification)
    {
        auto notificationActivatedEventArgs = args.Data().as<winrt::AppNotificationActivatedEventArgs>();
        ProcessNotificationArgs(notificationActivatedEventArgs);
    }

    // other app init and then message loop here

    // Cleanup event handler
    manager.NotificationInvoked(token);

    // Call Unregister() before exiting main so that subsequent invocations will launch a new process
    manager.Unregister();
    return 0;
}
```

## Displaying an App Notification

To display a Notification, an app needs to define a payload in xml. In the example below, the
developer wants to do a bunch of things: Replace a prior chat notification from a friend for a
specific chat group. The developer also wants to make sure that the notification is deleted in case
the user reboots the machine.

```cpp
void DisplayNotificationForFriend(winrt::hstring const& payload, winrt::hstring const& friendId, winrt::hstring const& chatGroupId)
{
    winrt::AppNotification notification(payload);

    // Setting GroupId here ensures that the Notification is only replaced for a specific chat group
    notification.Group(chatGroupId);

    // Setting friend id here ensures that the Notification only replaces the one from this specific friend
    notification.Tag(friendId);

    // Developer sets the Expiry property on reboot to true to delete the notification on reboot
    notification.ExpiresOnReboot(true);
    winrt::AppNotificationManager::Default().Show(notification);
}
```

## Processing a user generated Action on the Notification

The app will need to process the invocation in response to a User interacting with the Notification
in Action Centre. There are 2 common scenarios here after the invoke takes place:

1. The developer can choose to have the app launch in a specific UI context OR
2. The developer can choose to have the app evaluate an action specific behavior (like a button
   press in the payload body) without rendering any UI.

The example below goes through a scenario where the developer evaluates the Activation Arguments to
determine whether a foreground window needs to be rendered or whether some background business logic
needs to be run without any special UI rendering.

Note: activationType="background" in the Notification payload body is ignored for Desktop apps. It
is upto the developer to process the Activation Arguments and decide whether to display UI or not.

```cpp
//<toast launch="action=openThread&amp;threadId=92187">
//  <visual>
//      <binding template="ToastGeneric">
//          <text hint-maxLines="1">Jill Bender</text>
//          <text>Check out where we camped last weekend! Incredible!!</text>
//          <image placement="hero" src="https://constoso.com/360/180?image=1043" />
//      </binding>
//  </visual>
//  <actions>
//      <input id="textBox" type="text" placeHolderContent="reply" / >
//      <action
//          content="Send"
//          imageUri="Assets/Icons/send.png"
//          hint-inputId="textBox"
//          activationType="background"
//          arguments="action=reply&amp;threadId=92187" />
//  </actions>
//</toast>

void ProcessNotificationArgs(const winrt::AppNotificationActivatedEventArgs& notificationActivatedEventArgs)
{
    // If the user clicks on a toast, the code will need to launch the chat thread window
    if (std::wstring(notificationActivatedEventArgs.Argument().c_str()).find(L"openThread") != std::wstring::npos)
    {
        GenerateChatThreadWindow();
    }
    else // If the user responds to a message by clicking a button in the notification, we will need to reply back to the other user
    if (std::wstring(notificationActivatedEventArgs.Argument().c_str()).find(L"reply") != std::wstring::npos)
    {
        auto input = notificationActivatedEventArgs.UserInput();
        auto replyBoxText = input.Lookup(L"ReplyBox");

        // Process the reply text
        SendReplyToUser(replyBoxText);
    }
}
```

## Processing Active Notifications

We define Active Notifications as payloads that have already been displayed by the app and show up
in the Action Centre. In this example, the developer want to delete all Active Notifications from a
former friend except if the Notification falls under the Archived group.

```cpp
winrt::Windows::Foundation::IAsyncAction RemoveAllNotificationsFromFormerFriendAsync(const std::wstring friendId)
{
    winrt::AppNotificationManager manager = winrt::AppNotificationManager::Default();
    auto notifications = co_await manager.GetAllAsync();

    for (auto notification : notifications)
    {
        // We remove all notifications with the friend who sent them.The tag is the friendId.
        // We target all possible chat groups where this friend is present except the Archived group
        if (notification.Tag() == friendId && notification.Group() != L"Archived")
        {
            co_await manager.RemoveByTagAndGroupAsync(notification.Tag(), notification.Group());
        }
    }
}
```

## Notification Progress Updates

Sometimes a developer would like to show progress bar related updates in a Notification:

![Notification Progress](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/design/shell/tiles-and-notifications/images/toast-progressbar-annotated.png)

To accomplish that, the developer will need to use the AppNotificationProgressData construct to
update the progress bar on the screen.

```cpp

const winrt::hstring c_tag = L"weekly-playlist";
const winrt::hstring c_group = L"downloads";

// Send first Notification Progress Update
void SendUpdatableNotificationWithProgress()
{
    winrt::hstring payload =
        LR"(<toast launch="action = viewDownload &amp; downloadId = 9438108">
        <visual>
            <binding template = "ToastGeneric">
                <text>Downloading this week's new music...</text>
                <progress
                    title = "{progressTitle}"
                    value = "{progressValue}"
                    valueStringOverride = "{progressValueString}"
                    status = "{progressStatus}" />
            </binding>
        </visual>
    </toast>)";

    winrt::AppNotification notification(payload);
    notification.Tag(c_tag);
    notification.Group(c_group);

    // Assign initial values for first notification progress UI
    winrt::AppNotificationProgressData data(1);
    data.Title(L"Weekly playlist"); // Binds to {progressTitle} in xml payload
    data.Value(0.6); // Binds to {progressValue} in xml payload
    data.ValueStringOverride(L"15/26 songs"); // Binds to {progressValueString} in xml payload
    data.Status(L"Downloading..."); // Binds to {progressStatus} in xml payload

    notification.Progress(data);
    winrt::AppNotificationManager::Default().Show(notification);
}

// Send subsequent progress updates
winrt::Windows::Foundation::IAsyncAction UpdateProgressAsync()
{
    // Assign new values
    winrt::AppNotificationProgressData data(2 /* Sequence number */ );
    data.Title(L"Weekly playlist"); // Binds to {progressTitle} in xml payload
    data.Value(0.7); // Binds to {progressValue} in xml payload
    data.ValueStringOverride(L"18/26 songs"); // Binds to {progressValueString} in xml payload
    data.Status(L"Downloading..."); // Binds to {progressStatus} in xml payload

    auto result = co_await winrt::AppNotificationManager::Default().UpdateAsync(data, c_tag, c_group);
    if (result == winrt::AppNotificationProgressResult::AppNotificationNotFound)
    {
        // Toast Progress Update Failed since the previous notification update is dismissed by the user! So account for this in your logic by stopping updates or starting a new Progress Update flow.
    }
}
```

# Remarks

## Registration

Call AppNotificationManager::Register() first to register the current process as the target for
Notification invokes. When the app is terminating, the developer should call
AppNotificationManager::Unregister() to free up COM and allow for subsequent invokes to launch a new
process.

## Event Handlers

Subscribe to Notification event handlers to handle invocations if the process happens to be already
running. If this isn't done, the OS will launch a new process for every subsequent invocation.

## Manifest Registration

For Packaged applications, the COM activator CLSID and the process module(.exe file) need to be
specified in the manifest as part of the desktop and com extensions. In the example below, we use an
activatorId = "1920DBA9-0F64-4F0D-8A4B-5E207B812E61". The launch args would need to be pre-set to
"----AppNotificationActivated:" to ensure that WinAppSDK can process the payload as an
AppNotification Kind.

```xml
<Extensions>
    <desktop:Extension Category="windows.toastNotificationActivation">
		<desktop:ToastNotificationActivation ToastActivatorCLSID="1920DBA9-0F64-4F0D-8A4B-5E207B812E61" />
	</desktop:Extension>
    <com:Extension Category="windows.comServer">
        <com:ComServer>
            <com:ExeServer Executable="SampleBackgroundApp\SampleBackgroundApp.exe" DisplayName="SampleBackgroundApp" Arguments="----AppNotificationActivated:">
                <com:Class Id="1920DBA9-0F64-4F0D-8A4B-5E207B812E61" />
            </com:ExeServer>
        </com:ComServer>
    </com:Extension>
</Extensions>
```

# Appendix

-   To support Cloud Sourced Notifications, the Windows App SDK will have to implement some
    specialized mapping for Local and Push Registrations in the WinAppSDK Singleton Package.
-   Since building XML payloads at runtime is non-trivial, we encourage developers to utilize the
    [Windows Community Toolkit](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/communitytoolkit/), specifically
    the
    [ToastContentBuilder](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.toolkit.uwp.notifications.toastcontentbuilder)
    APIs to construct the XML payload in the short term.
