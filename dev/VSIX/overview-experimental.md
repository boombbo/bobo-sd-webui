The Microsoft Windows App SDK is a new set of developer components and tools that represents the 
next evolution in the Windows app development platform. It provides a unified set of APIs and tools
that can be used in a consistent way by any app on a broad set of target Windows 10 OS versions.

This is an experimental version of the Microsoft Windows App SDK. It contains features under 
development that may appear in future releases.
