The Windows App SDK (previously called Project Reunion) is a set of new developer components and tools that represent the next evolution in the Windows app development platform. The Windows App SDK provides a unified set of APIs and tools that can be used in a consistent way by any desktop app on Windows 11 and down level to Windows 10 version 1809.

The latest release of the Windows App SDK is v1.0 stable. This version is supported for building production desktop apps and shipping them to the Microsoft Store, and includes the following components:

WinUI 3
DWriteCore
MRTCore
WebView2
If youâ€™d like to use experimental features in a non-production app, see Project Reunion (Preview) VSIX.

Note: The Windows App SDK was previously known by the code name Project Reunion. Some SDK assets such as this VSIX extension and NuGet packages still use the code name, but these assets will be renamed in a future release.
