# Welcome to MRT Core!

## Overview 

### What is MRT Core?
Thanks for asking! MRT Core was born from the need for [Project Reunion](https://aka.ms/projectreunion) applications to use MRT - Modern Resource Technology. MRT was introduced to Windows in the Windows 8 timeframe and has evolved as the resource management system since that time. You can use these links to learn more about [MRT and resource management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/app-resources/resource-management-system) as well as the benefits of [globalization and localization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/globalizing/globalizing-portal).

> If you're looking for Core MRT, you're in the right place! Internal project naming was Core MRT and so some of our external communication has also used that terminology - sorry for any confusion! But rest assured, Core MRT or MRT Core, you're in the right place! ðŸ˜‰

### So what does it do?
At its *core* ðŸ˜Ž MRT Core provides support to build resource Package Resource Index (PRI) files, and load resources from PRI files. [Learn more about PRI files at this link.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/app-resources/resource-management-system)

## Getting Started
Install the NuGet package from [https://aka.ms/MRTCore](https://aka.ms/MRTCore), and you are ready to build PRI files from Visual Studio
and use MRT Core APIs to load resources in your app.

The C APIs can be found in [mrm.h](mrt/Core/src/MRM.h). The WinRT APIs can be found in [Microsoft.ApplicationModel.Resources.idl](mrt/Microsoft.ApplicationModel.Resources/src/Microsoft.ApplicationModel.Resources.idl).

## Build and Test
Load [MrtCore.sln](mrt/MrtCore.sln) in Visual Studion 2019, and build the solution. 

Run the tests in Test Explorer.
