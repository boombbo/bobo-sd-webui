# Markdown

**DO** wrap lines at ~100 characters. GitHub formats lines regardless of individual length but
GitHub diff is line oriented. Keeping lines within the preferred limit makes changes easier to
review. Use a tool like Prettier to bulk-reformat files, or configure your editor's "rulers." If new
languages become common, we will describe the coding guidelines for such languages here.
