# Pull Request
When your code is in tip-top shape it is time to make a Pull Request (PR) into main.  A PR is a
formal request to merge your code into main.

## Building
Before the PR can be accepted the code needs to run through the build pipeline to make sure your
changes work with the existing code.  

To run the build pipeline add the comment `/azp run`.  You do not need permission to run the
pipeline.
